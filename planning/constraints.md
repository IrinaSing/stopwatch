# Constraints

Due to the late start and complexity of this individual progect, I going to follow these constraints:

- Complete one page with one program function (stopwatch, timer or pomodoro).
- Skip drawing a wireframe, because it is enough to look at the original website.
- Skip Readme for now - it is progect for my own, not for external evaluation.
- Skip work on visual design, use CSS library.
